# SAPM Exporter

The SAPM exporter builds on the Jaeger proto and adds additional batching on top. This allows
the collector to export traces from multiples nodes/services in a single batch. The SAPM proto
and some useful related utilities can be found [here](https://github.com/signalfx/sapm-proto/).

- `access_token` (no default): AccessToken is the authentication token provided by SignalFx or
another backend that supports the SAPM proto.
- `endpoint` (no default): This is the destination to where traces will be sent to in SAPM
format. It must be a full URL and include the scheme, port and path e.g,
https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace. This can be pointed to the SignalFx backend or to
another Otel collector that has the SAPM receiver enabled.
- `max_connections` (default = 100): MaxConnections is used to set a limit to the maximum
idle HTTP connection the exporter can keep open.
- `num_workers` (default = 8): NumWorkers is the number of workers that should be used to
export traces. Exporter can make as many requests in parallel as the number of workers. Note
that this will likely be removed in future in favour of processors handling parallel exporting.

Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  sapm:
    access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    endpoint: https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com
    max_connections: 100
    num_workers: 8
```

Beyond standard YAML configuration as outlined in the sections that follow,
exporters that leverage the net/http package (all do today) also respect the
following proxy environment variables:

* HTTP_PROXY
* HTTPS_PROXY
* NO_PROXY

If set at Collector start time then exporters, regardless of protocol,
will or will not proxy traffic as defined by these environment variables.
